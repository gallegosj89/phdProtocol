	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven their efﬁciency in various applications in agriculture. In crops such as date, they have been mainly used in the identiﬁcation and sorting of ripe fruits. The aim of this study was the performance evaluation of eight different CNNs, considering transfer learning for their training, as well as ﬁve hyperparameters. The CNN architectures evaluated were VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, ResNet-152, AlexNet, Inception V3, and CNN from scratch. Likewise, the hyperparameters analyzed were the number of layers, the number of epochs, the batch size, optimizer, and learning rate. The accuracy and processing time were considered to determine the performance of CNN architectures, in the classiﬁcation of mature dates’ cultivar Medjool. The model obtained from VGG-19 architecture with a batch of 128 and Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01 presented the best performance with an accuracy of 99.32\%. We concluded that the VGG-19 model can be used to build computer vision systems that help producers improve their sorting process to detect the Tamar stage of a Medjool date.},

	abstract = {Date fruit (Phoenix dactylifera L.) is known for its diversity in terms of genotypes that differ in shape, color, texture, taste, and other physical and sensory attributes, in addition to biochemical compounds. This richness generates complex, long, and tedious work at the scale of farm as well as in handling, processing, and storage facilities to prepare standardized, and homogenous final products that deal with consumer preferences and needs. To alleviate this, an increased importance and particular trend were observed recently for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and computer vision technology since they are considered as accurate, objective, non-destructive, fast, and efficient emerging technologies. In this context, this manuscript provides comprehensive insights into key applications of AI techniques and computer vision technology, using different classification models and algorithms developed on the basis (for example) of neural network classifiers, such as convolutional and artificial neural network, on harvest and postharvest assessment of date fruit. Thus, the importance of date fruit dataset used in the AI domain was discussed with link to all accessible datasets in the field of date palm. In addition, available and relevant AI tools and approaches applied to the postharvest of date fruit from maturity distinguishing until storage through other key handling operations, sorting, grading, etc., were detailed in the five sections of this paper. In terms of conclusion, this review showed that these smart technologies can play a substantial role and offer new opportunities to improve the whole value chain of date palm sector.},

The quality of date palm fruit is much dependent on its postharvest handling and processing. For preventing the degradation and maintenance of the high quality of dates during the storage an appropriate harvest and post-harvest processes are required. The process should control the biotic and abiotic factors like insects, fungus, temperature, as well as handling and processing of dates. Therefore, in this work, we reviewed the literature related to the protection of date fruits during their post-harvest life. The commercially viable advance and updated techniques that can be used to avoid storage losses and problems while keeping fruit quality (nutritional, color, ﬂavor, and texture) and microbial safety under optimal conditions are discussed.},

	abstract = {This research conducted a bibliometric analysis of scholarly literature on fruit sorting and grading using machine vision, identifying primary themes, sources, most-cited publications, and countries. The literature and bibliometric analysis were thoroughly evaluated to consolidate knowledge, identify research trends, and propose specific research opportunities within the context of machine vision for fruit sorting and grading. Research articles from 2011 to 2023, indexed in the main collections of the Dimensions, Web-of-science, and Scopus databases, were examined. Findings were presented quantitatively, using tables and graphs to emphasize the key performance factors for article writing and citation. Upon applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 129 out of 1812 discovered articles were included for examination, while 1683 studies were excluded due to noncompliance with the requirements and duplicates. Thirty-four (34) case study publications on machine vision applications for fruit sorting and grading were comprehensively examined to identify the adopted methodologies and future research opportunities. Covered methodologies include fruit varieties, data volumes, data collection, classification methods, and accuracy metrics. The study’s findings indicate a significant increase in deep learning applications for fruit recognition in the recent five years (2019–2023), with excellent results achieved either by utilizing new models or with pre-trained networks for transfer learning. The research also identifies gaps and future directions for machine vision in fruit sorting and grading, such as enhancing system robustness, scalability, and adaptability, integrating multiple sensors and technological methods, and developing evaluation and comparison standards and criteria. The paper concludes that machine vision holds promise as a potent tool for fruit quality assessment, but further research and development are needed to address existing challenges and meet the growing demands of the fruit industry.},

	abstract = {Dates are an important part of human nutrition. Dates are high in essential nutrients and provide a number of health benefits. Date fruits are also known to protect against a number of diseases, including cancer and heart disease. Date fruits have several sizes, colors, tastes, and values. There are a lot of challenges facing the date producers. One of the most significant challenges is the classification and sorting of dates. But there is no public dataset for date fruits, which is a major limitation in order to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNN) models and avoid the overfitting problem. In this paper, an augmented date fruits dataset was developed using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) and CycleGAN approach to augment our collected date fruit datasets. This augmentation is required to address the issue of a restricted number of images in our datasets, as well as to establish a balanced dataset. There are three types of dates in our proposed dataset: Sukkari, Ajwa, and Suggai. After dataset augmentation, we train our created dataset using ResNet152V2 and CNN models to assess the classification process for our three categories in the dataset. To train these two models, we start with the original dataset. Thereafter, the models were trained using the DCGAN-generated dataset, followed by the CycleGAN-generated dataset. The resulting results demonstrated that when using the ResNet152V2 model, the CycleGAN-generated dataset had the highest classification performance with 96.8\% accuracy, followed by the CNN model with 94.3\% accuracy.},

Furthermore, quality of the date fruits stored in the storage may degrade with time and it is important to inspect the quality of date routinely. After date harvesting, the industrial companies start the inspection of dates. Inspection of date fruit is to isolate the damaged or defected dates from the good one. Industrial factories demand a high quality and fast production that can only be achieved by automatic inspection. In this paper, we propose a framework for inspection of the external quality of the date fruits through the image processing method. Images of the date fruit are classified into good quality and sugar-defected by using bag of feature (BOF) method. The methodology includes five main stages including key points detection, feature extraction, creating a dictionary, vector quantization and classification. Proposed framework is tested on the dataset collected by the authors using two types of key-points detection methods. Best classification accuracy for grid based search was 99\% and 84\% for SURF based key-points detection method on the testing dataset.},

	abstract = {This work proposes an innovative autonomous system based on intelligent deep-transfer learning for the sustainable harvesting of palm trees. The machine learning-based autonomous robot detects and captures the date fruit bunches on palm trees in the natural farm environment using the lightweight you only look once (YOLO)v8 algorithm. Five different types of fruit bunches are further classified using a deep transfer learning system based on the type (Khalas, Barhi, Sullaj, Meneifi, and Naboot Saif) and the maturity stage of date fruit (Immature, Khalal, Khalal with Rutab, Pre-Tamar, and Tamar) for their efficient, faster, and accurate harvesting. Five deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models, the Alex Krizhevsky network (AlexNet), the visual geometry group (VGG-16), the residual network (ResNet-50), Inception-v3 and Efficient Net, were trained on around 12,000 images at the bunch level for the two classification tasks. The findings of various performed experiments suggested that the VGG-16 network outperforms the compared models with maximum achieved testing accuracies of 98.89\% and 98.17\% for date type and maturity stage classification, respectively. The obtained testing accuracies of AlexNet, ResNet-50, Efficient Net, and Inception-v3 models are 97.33\%, 97.87\%, 98.39\%, 96.61\% 98\%, 93\%, and 86.5\% for both date type/maturity stage predictions. These obtained accuracies are superior than the state-of-the-art legacy models. Autonomous robotic vehicle front and top cameras are used to localize the quick response (QR)-labeled palm trees using canny edge detection and hough transformation, and date bunch detection and capturing using the trained YOLOv8 algorithm. The robotic vehicle transfers all captured images using Firebase after the completion of the farm journey. The developed and integrated front-end user interface (UI) provides ease to farmers for the two classification tasks of the retrieved images, along with the harvesting decision for each image. The use of proposed sustainable smart harvesting robots to classify and analyze date bunches in the natural environment can significantly improve the yield and global supply chain of this fruit.},

With the rapid increase in population, the objectives of the future agro-industry are to reduce product loss while increasing product quality and productivity considerably. Consequently, farmers need to be assisted with cutting-edge technologies for sustainable, eco-friendly, and efficient farming. Smart farming for early disease recognition and control is the current hot-spot research objective in the fruitage domain. The precision agriculture era has been revolutionized by federating cutting-edge technologies like machine learning, deep learning, and, the Internet-of-Things. However, the existing studies focused on the impact of individual technology on single or multiple cultivars of edible fruits or vegetables. Limited areas of the fruitage disease remain explored, necessitating further investigation into the research gaps and challenges identified for implementing the smart practices in real-field farmlands. In this paper, a comprehensive survey of recent advancements in fruit and vegetable disease identification and classification is presented. The technology-wise state-of-the-art findings, gaps, challenges, and future opportunities for fruitage disease recognition have been presented, covering 99 research articles. Moreover, the corpus of publicly available fruit and vegetable datasets has been investigated, with the existing gaps, improvements, and future requirements. The research paper concludes with challenges and a future outlook that promises to be a very significant and valuable resource for researchers working in the area of agronomic disease monitoring.},

	abstract = {The implementation of deep learning algorithms has contributed to various applications related to the detection of fruit quality. The quality attributes of fruit such as total soluble solids, moisture content, pH, colour changes, and firmness at different varieties can be predicted according to different storage conditions with reliable classification accuracy. The advances in non-destructive techniques have led to the rapid utilisation of the imaging approach in order to monitor the fruit quality. These image datasets encompass diverse information which requires extensive data extraction. To overcome this issue, a deep learning approach using convolutional neural network was used to evaluate the fruit quality. A graphical user interface-based software (DLFRUIT-GUI) for data processing of fruit quality is developed. The toolbox allows the model training and selection based on the image datasets of the fruit. The software offers a push-button approach to establish deep learning models for monitoring fruit quality. The adoption of convolutional neural network model successfully improves the model performance which demonstrated efficient results in predicting the fruit quality at different varieties according to various storage conditions. The DLFRUIT-GUI toolbox provides rapid monitoring of fruit quality detection that can easily be accessible by users who have no programming skills and tedious data analysis.},

It also plays a key role in identifying and distinguishing dried products, benefiting end consumers and the food processing industry. In this study, jujube slices were microwave-dried with and without ultrasound pretreatment at 100, 200, 300, and 600 W (watt) power. The classification models were explored based on an image data set using ConvNeXt\_Tiny, ResNet-18, Densenet-121, ConvNeXtBase, and EfficientNet-B1 deep learning models, which are widely used in the Fastai library and developed based on the transfer learning technique. Considering model accuracy and computational cost, using images with an input image size of 224*224 is efficient. Experimental results revealed that at the end of 20 iterations, the accuracy results of the models reached 95 \%, 98 \%, 99 \%, 98 \%, and 99 \% for ResNet-18, ConvNeXt-Tiny, DenseNet-121, and ConvNeXt-Base and EfficientNet-B1 algorithms, respectively, and the models showed a tendency to converge. It is observed that the DenseNet-121 and EfficientNet-B1 models had the best accuracy rate. The precision, recall, and F1-score also support these results. The proposed models can potentially be used for non-invasive, effective, and rapid classification of dried fruits on the embedded system in a related application.},

	abstract = {Accurate identification of different fruit varieties is essential for suppliers, processors and consumers, particularly during grading, breeding and harvest timing. Traditional manual recognition is inefficient, while image-based methods often struggle to differentiate different varieties with similar appearances. Additionally, analysing the internal chemical composition of fruits is complex and requires specialised expertise, making the process cumbersome. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has gained increasing attention for fruit variety identification due to its ability to rapidly assess internal fruit characteristics. However, NIRS data often exhibit high redundancy and low variability, which make effective analysis challenging, thus requiring advanced machine learning techniques. In recent years, deep learning has demonstrated promising results in fruit classification using NIRS. However, NIRS data contain important positional information, which convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often struggle to capture effectively due to their limited ability to process continuity and spatial relationships. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that combines gated recurrent units (GRUs) with a twostream network architecture. GRUs are adept at learning and memorising the relationships between the start and end positions of spectral sequences, while the two-stream network integrates the strengths of both CNNs and GRUs, enabling the model to simultaneously capture local features and sequence information. Additionally, we incorporate a simple attention mechanism and a new feature module to enhance the model’s ability to represent features. Experimental results on NIRS data for 10 mango varieties and 4 blueberry cultivars demonstrate that our model achieves a 15 \%–20 \% higher classification accuracy than traditional machine learning methods and other fruit classification approaches. When combined with XGBoost, the model’s classification accuracy reached 95 \% for mangoes and 96 \% for blueberries, underscoring its robustness and adaptability. This method holds significant potential for applications such as fruit grading, breeding and harvesting, offering a promising path to improving both efficiency and accuracy for suppliers, processors and consumers.},

	abstract = {Vegetable and fruit freshness detecting can ensure that consumers get vegetables and fruits with good taste and rich nutrition, improve the health level of diet, and ensure that the agricultural and food industries provide highquality products to meet consumer needs and increase sales and market share. At present, the freshness detection of vegetables and fruits mainly relies on manual observation and judgment, which has the problems of subjectivity and low accuracy, and it is difficult to meet the needs of large-scale, high-efficiency, and rapid detection. Although some studies have shown that large-scale detection of vegetable and fruit freshness can be carried out based on artificially extracted features, there is still the problem of poor adaptability of artificially extracted features, which leads to low efficiency of freshness detection. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel method for detecting the freshness of vegetables and fruits more objectively, accurately and efficiently using deep features extracted by pre-trained deep learning models of different architectures. First, resized images of vegetables and fruits are fed into a pre-trained deep learning model for deep feature extraction. Then, the deep features are fused and the fused deep features are dimensionally reduced to a representative low-dimensional feature space by principal component analysis. Finally, vegetable and fruit freshness are detected by three machine learning methods. The experimental results show that combining the deep features extracted by the three architecture pre-trained deep learning models GoogLeNet, DenseNet-201 and ResNeXt-101 combined with PCA dimensionality reduction processing has achieved the highest accuracy rate of 96.98\% for vegetable and fruit freshness detection. This research concluded that the proposed method is promising to improve the efficiency of freshness detection of vegetables and fruits.},

However, optimizing CNN architectures and their associated hyperparameters for specific tasks is challenging. In this study, we explore the development of 1D-CNN architectures for the task of fruit dry matter (DM) estimation, testing various designs and optimization strategies to achieve a generic DL model that is robust against data fluctuations. The models are built using a multi-fruit data set (n = 2397) that includes NIR spectra of apples, kiwis, mangoes, and pears. The obtained CNN models are compared with PLS (taken as baseline), and to Locally Weighted PLS (LW-PLS) models. In general, the optimized CNN architectures obtained lower RMSEs (best RMSE = 0.605 \%) than PLS (RMSE = 0.892 \%) and LW-PLS (RMSE = 0.687 \%) on a holdout test set. For this specific task, CNNs start outperforming PLS when the number of training samples is around 500. Furthermore, it is also shown how a global CNN model, trained on multifruit data, performs against PLS models of individual fruits in the sub-tasks of individual fruit DM prediction and generalization to an external mango data set. Overall, with proper architecture optimization, CNNs show strong performance and generalization for NIR-based dry matter estimation across diverse fruits.},

Firstly, a method was proposed that utilized particle swarm optimization (PSO) to search for the optimal hyperparameters (batch size and learning rate) in the convolutional neural network regression (CNNR) model. The prediction performance of various models including partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machine regression (SVR), AlexNet, and CNNR was compared using both raw spectral data and preprocessed data. Then, four feature extraction algorithms (successive projection algorithm (SPA), competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), PSO, and the optimal DL framework) were used to extract spectral variables. The optimal hybrid prediction model PSO-CNN-SVR was determined, with coefficient of determination (R2P) of 0.918 in prediction set. In addition, the optimal simplified model was used to generate spatial distributions to visualize MC in Camellia oleifera seeds.

Spotting unnaturally ripened fruits is crucial for the quality and safety of food, but current models are inefficient or too complicated, especially for diverse fruit varieties. Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as well as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) extraction and selection of features techniques are combined using Extended Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with Convolutional Neural Networks to deal with these challenges. The proposed structure segments fruit thermal pictures employing Saliency Maps to draw attention to relevant areas. LSTM and GRU models are fused to produce multiscale sets of characteristics, allowing the model to record temporal along with geographic characteristics. A Bacterial Foraging Optimizer (BFO) built around variance maximization retains high-density as well as discriminative features during feature selection. A novel Convolutional XGBoost Network (CXGBN) combines CNN's completely connected layers with XGBoost classifications for enhanced efficiency. On Mango as well as Apple data sets, precision, reliability, as well as recall improved 8.3\%, 4.9\%, and 3.4\%. The model efficiently identified artificially ripened fruits, decreasing classifying delays by 6.5\%. This study presents a novel hybrid framework for spotting prematurely ripened fruits using LSTM-GRU fusion and XGBoost CNN. The proposed model outperforms and scales existing methods by solving inefficiencies and using advanced optimization as well as classification techniques. It will be tested for adaptability to other fruit types and real-time applications using low-complexity feature sets along with advanced methods like Q-Learning as well as Auto Encoders that will enhance dynamical performance.},

Kinetic drying, effective moisture diffusion (Deff) and activation energy were examined. Midilli et al. model was the best fit to predict MR. Higher air temperature reduced drying time and moisture content, while Deff increased for uncoated and coated dried pineapples of 1.69 × 10 9 to 5.57 × 10 9 m2/s and 1.60 × 10 9 to 5.95 × 10 9 m2/s with the activation energy (Ea) of 37.68 and 41.61 kJ/mol, respectively. Interestingly, the edible coating did not significantly affect Deff and Ea, but it retained ascorbic acid. Moreover, ANNs model was appropriate for the prediction of the MR and DR of dehydrated pineapple cubes, as this model had the highest R2 and accuracy with the lowest RMSE and MAE. The ANNs models with topology of 3–14-14-1 for MR and 3-7-7-1 for DR predictions were the optimal to estimate the drying process of uncoated and coated fruits with satisfactory accuracy and benefit for food industry.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to develop an intelligent capacitive system to measure the moisture content of date fruit and to recognize fruit characteristics, such as variety, size, and ripeness. A cost-effective and fast non-contact measurement solution using the capacitive method was employed to create a platform with a variable oscillator to measure the dielectric properties of date fruit after harvest. Different date varieties, namely Zahedi, Ghasb, Mazafati and Medjool, representing dry, semi-dry and wet date fruit, respectively, were selected to model and calibrate the proposed system. Samples of date fruit of each variety were selected at three different ripening stages (Khalal, Rutab and Tamr), ranging from high to low moisture content. Additionally, five distinct moisture contents were determined using the oven method. The moisture content of the date fruit samples ranged from 8.6 \% to 86.9 \% owing to the selection of four varieties, three ripening stages and five stepwise thermal treatments. After acquiring electronic information, 80 \% of the dataset was allocated for training purposes, while the remaining 20 \% was reserved for evaluating the final regression model. The results showed that of all the trained machine learning models, Support Vector Regression (SVR) had the highest potential for predicting moisture content at the specified frequencies. The SVR model was fine-tuned by fitting 1824 combinations of hyperparameters over 6 folds. The tuned model’s prediction for 20 \% of the assigned test data resulted in a coefficient of determination of 88 \% compared to the actual moisture content, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 9.4 \%. Furthermore, the dielectric-based system classified the ripening stages using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model, achieving F1 scores of 87 \%, 60 \% and 68 \% for the Khalal, Rutab and Tamr stages, respectively. The MLP regression model also predicted the geometric mean of the date fruit with a coefficient of determination of 0.82 and an RMSE of 3.05 mm.},

	abstract = {Date fruit, a vital agricultural product in the Middle East area, is harvested annually in millions of metric tons and is renowned for its abundant nutrients. With computer vision and machine learning techniques, automatic date fruit classification enables farmers and supermarkets to differentiate between various varieties and qualities of date fruits within their inventory. Date fruits have unique physical characteristics, such as shape, size, color, texture, and skin type that are important in determining their variety and quality. These characteristics can vary significantly depending on the cultivar, growing conditions, and ripening stage of the date fruits. This paper presents a novel date fruit type classification and grading system achieved through the feature-level fusion of deep learning features and wavelet scattering features. Wavelet scattering features are extracted at varying levels of decomposition; enabling reliable extraction of information from diverse channels. To extract deep features this study utilizes pre-trained architectures, including Alexnet, Googlenet, Resnet, and MobileNetV2. The proposed methodology has been experimentally evaluated with the Date Fruit in Controlled Environment dataset, which has nine classes, and has yielded an accuracy of 95.9\% for date species classification. Various date fruit species from the TU-DG dataset were graded, and for Ajwa species, the accuracy is 97.8\%, for Mabroom, 92.6\% accuracy, and for Sukkary, 99.5\% accuracy.},

	abstract = {Agriculture remains a cornerstone for ensuring food security and is a vital employment sector, particularly in developing countries like India, where it contributes around 20\% to the GDP. The agricultural process spans three crucial phases: preharvesting, harvesting, and post-harvesting. Recent advances in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) have revolutionized agriculture, offering innovative solutions to long-standing challenges. From crop disease detection and yield estimation in pre-harvesting, to real-time monitoring and automation during harvesting, and post-harvest quality control and loss reduction—these technologies have signiﬁcantly enhanced productivity and precision. This paper provides an in-depth review of AI and CV applications across these stages, outlining the techniques used, challenges faced, and open issues that persist. The integration of these technologies not only minimizes labor but also improves crop quality and reduces losses, setting the stage for smarter, data-driven agriculture. However, signiﬁcant hurdles such as data scarcity, model generalization, and technology adoption still remain, necessitating further research.},

	abstract = {AbstractThis study aimed to predict the toughness of date palm fruit (Barhi, Saqie, and Khodry varieties) at different ripening stages (Khalal, Rutab, and Tamar) using Hertz Theory by evaluating the physical and mechanical characteristics of the fruits. Physical measurements revealed that high moisture content in the Khalal stage led to larger dimensions and mass across all varieties, with Barhi dates showing a moisture content of 63.31\%, which decreased to 32.60\% at Rutab as the fruit dehydrated. This moisture reduction also impacted other characteristics, such as bulk density, volume, and flesh thickness, resulting in a concentrated, denser structure in the Tamar stage. Mechanical analysis demonstrated significant softening in all varieties as they transitioned from Khalal to Rutab stages, with Barhi dates’ modulus of elasticity dropping from 548.83 to 16.72 kPa. Similarly, bioyield and rupture stress decreased, highlighting the influence of moisture loss on textural characteristics. Saqie and Khodry varieties followed similar trends, with initial softening from Khalal to Rutab, and a slight firmness increase at Tamar due to dehydration. The force-deformation curves and toughness measurements confirmed these findings, showing significant reductions in toughness from Khalal to Rutab, with a slight increase in Tamar. These results underscore the pronounced textural and structural changes as dates ripen, influencing their suitability for different applications. Also, the measured toughness (τm) closely aligned with predicted toughness (τp), with significant textural differences observed across varieties and ripening stages. For all varieties, the τp is approximately 0.00–9.24\% lower than the τm. Finally, the derived equation can be used with enough confidence to theoretically predict the toughness of date palm fruit.},

	abstract = {The red palm weevil (RPW) represents a significant danger to palm trees farms all over the world, which will result in considerable financial losses. The absence of apparent signs until the death of the palm tree makes it difficult to identify RPW infections at an early stage. The prompt detection of RPW diseases is further complicated by large-scale farms. In order to accomplish early detection of RPW using image analysis, this paper proposed a RPW classification model based on the proposed modified ResNet-34 deep learning architecture. A dataset of 483 images is used to assess the model’s performance. For the assessment, two different dataset settings are used. In the initial dataset setup, images are divided into three groups: adults, eggs, and Pupae. Four additional categories are added to the classification in the second dataset setup: female adults, male adults, eggs, and pupae. Experimental findings show the usefulness of the proposed model, with a remarkable total accuracy of 98\% for both dataset setups. These results highlight the value of using the modified ResNet-34 architecture for the early detection of RPW. Moreover, the findings demonstrated that the proposed model offers great potential for decreasing the negative effects of RPW on palm tree farms and preventing financial losses in the agriculture sector.},

The system of our interest is a date fruit-harvesting robot. The robot will detect, analyze and cut the date bunch from the palm tree. In this work, a state of art object detection algorithm, the You Only Look Once version 3 (YOLOv3), is used to solve the detection and localization of date bunches problem. Unstructured agricultural environments with constantly changing light, and shadow, make date fruit detection challenging. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to deal with these problems, giving high accuracy. Based on the model output, the robot can detect and locate dates in images to make the harvesting decision.},

	abstract = {The popularity and demand for high-quality date palm fruits (Phoenix dactylifera L.) have been growing, and their quality largely depends on the type of handling, storage, and processing methods. The current methods of geometric evaluation and classification of date palm fruits are characterised by high labour intensity and are usually performed mechanically, which may cause additional damage and reduce the quality and value of the product. Therefore, non-contact methods are being sought based on image analysis, with digital solutions controlling the evaluation and classification processes. The main objective of this paper is to develop an automatic classification model for varieties of date palm fruits using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on two fundamental criteria, i.e., colour difference and evaluation of geometric parameters of dates. A CNN with a fixed architecture was built, marked as DateNET, consisting of a system of five alternating Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dropout classes. The validation accuracy of the model presented in this study depended on the selection of classification criteria. It was 85.24\% for fruit colour-based classification and 87.62\% for the geometric parameters only; however, it increased considerably to 93.41\% when both the colour and geometry of dates were considered.},

	abstract = {A total of 8.46 million tons of date fruit are produced annually around the world. The date fruit is considered a high-valued confectionery and fruit crop. The hot arid zones of Southwest Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East are the major producers of date fruit. The production of dates in 1961 was 1.8 million tons, which increased to 2.8 million tons in 1985. In 2001, the production of dates was recorded at 5.4 million tons, whereas recently it has reached 8.46 million tons. A common problem found in the industry is the absence of an autonomous system for the classiﬁcation of date fruit, resulting in reliance on only the manual expertise, often involving hard work, expense, and bias. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been employed in such areas of agriculture and fruit farming and have brought great convenience to human life. An automated system based on ML can carry out the fruit classiﬁcation and sorting tasks that were previously handled by human experts. In various ﬁelds, CNNs (convolutional neural networks) have achieved impressive results in image classiﬁcation. Considering the success of CNNs and transfer learning in other image classiﬁcation problems, this research also employs a similar approach and proposes an efﬁcient date classiﬁcation model. In this research, a dataset of eight different classes of date fruit has been created to train the proposed model. Different preprocessing techniques have been applied in the proposed model, such as image augmentation, decayed learning rate, model checkpointing, and hybrid weight adjustment to increase the accuracy rate. The results show that the proposed model based on MobileNetV2 architecture has achieved 99\% accuracy. The proposed model has also been compared with other existing models such as AlexNet, VGG16, InceptionV3, ResNet, and MobileNetV2. The results prove that the proposed model performs better than all other models in terms of accuracy.},

Classifying, identifying, and recognizing dates would play a crucial role in the agriculture, commercial, food, and health sectors. Nevertheless, there is no or limited work to collect a reliable dataset for many classes. In this paper, we collected the dataset of date fruits by picturing dates from primary environments: farms and shops (e.g., online or local markets). The combined dataset is unique due to the multiplicity of items. To our knowledge, no dataset contains the same number of classes from natural environments. The collected dataset has 27 classes with 3228 images. The experimental results presented are based on ﬁve stages. The ﬁrst stage applied traditional machine learning algorithms for measuring the accuracy of features based on pixel intensity and color distribution. The second stage applied a deep transfer learning (TL) model to select the best model accuracy of date classiﬁcation. In the third stage, the feature extraction part of the model was ﬁne-tuned by applying different retrained points to select the best retraining point. In the fourth stage, the fully connected layer of the model was ﬁnetuned to achieve the best classiﬁcation conﬁgurations of the model. In the ﬁfth stage, regularization was applied to the classiﬁcation layer of the best-selected model from the fourth stage, where the validation accuracy reached 97.21\% and the best test accuracy was 95.21\%.},

	abstract = {Classifying the quality of dates after harvesting the crop plays a signiﬁcant role in reducing waste from date fruit production. About one million tons of date fruit is produced annually in Saudi Arabia. Part of this production goes to local factories to be produced and packaged to be ready for use. Classifying and sorting edible dates from inedible dates is one of the ﬁrst and most important stages in the production process in the date fruit industry. As this process is still performed manually in date production factories in Saudi Arabia, this may cause an increase in the waste of date fruit and reduce the efﬁciency of production. Therefore, in our paper, we propose a system to automate the classiﬁcation of dates fruit production. The proposed system focuses on classifying the quality of date fruit at the postharvesting stage. By automating the process of classifying date fruit at this stage, we can increase the production efﬁciency, raise the classiﬁcation accuracy, control the product quality, and perform data analysis within the industry. As a result, this increases the market competitiveness, reduces production costs, and increases the productivity. The system was developed based on convolutional neural network models. For the purpose of training the models, we constructed a new image dataset that contains two main classes that have images of date fruit with excellent surface quality and another class for date fruit with poor surface quality. The results show that the used model can classify date fruit based on their surface quality with an accuracy of 97\%.},

	abstract = {The analysis and classification of dates is based on their external features: size, appearance, shape, and colour. The process is currently performed manually after harvesting as part of the postharvesting process. Grading manually is tedious because it usually results in time delays, product quality risks, and it is associated with time and cost delays as well. Although the use of computers and information technology has seen tremendous growth in many small and large sectors, it has been in its infancy in the cultivation of fruit and dates. Using image processing algorithms, we can enhance human vision capabilities through analysis and make images easier to comprehend. A major objective of computer vision-based algorithms for classifying and sorting of dates is to make the procedure fully automated by minimizing the manual component involved in the process. This paper presents an image processing-based algorithm that uses machine learning techniques to extract the characteristics of colour intensity and colour homogeneity, allowing us to grade images in a more timely and automated manner. In order to obtain the results, we extracted the appearance of the date images based on an image processing algorithm. It is used as a validation element for the results that the quality of dates-fruit images can be evaluated through the prior selection process in both separate and in groups.

	abstract = {Fruit quality is a critical factor in the produce industry, affecting producers, distributors, consumers, and the economy. High-quality fruits are more appealing, nutritious, and safe, boosting consumer satisfaction and revenue for producers. Artiﬁcial intelligence can aid in assessing the quality of fruit using images. This paper presents a general machine learning model for assessing fruit quality using deep image features. This model leverages the learning capabilities of the recent successful networks for image classiﬁcation called vision transformers (ViT). The ViT model is built and trained with a combination of various fruit datasets and taught to distinguish between good and rotten fruit images based on their visual appearance and not predeﬁned quality attributes. The general model demonstrated impressive results in accurately identifying the quality of various fruits, such as apples (with a 99.50\% accuracy), cucumbers (99\%), grapes (100\%), kakis (99.50\%), oranges (99.50\%), papayas (98\%), peaches (98\%), tomatoes (99.50\%), and watermelons (98\%). However, it showed slightly lower performance in identifying guavas (97\%), lemons (97\%), limes (97.50\%), mangoes (97.50\%), pears (97\%), and pomegranates (97\%).},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has recently emerged as a promising tool for various agricultural applications. However, high equipment cost, instrumentation complexity, and dataintensive nature have limited its widespread adoption. To overcome these challenges, reconstructing hyperspectral data from simple, cost-effective color or RGB (red-green-blue) images using advanced deep learning algorithms offers a practically attractive solution for a wide range of applications in food quality control and assurance. Through advanced deep learning algorithms, it is possible to capture and reconstruct spectral information from simple, cost-effective RGB imaging to create a reliable, efficient, and scalable system with accuracy comparable to dedicated, expensive HSI systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in deep learning techniques for HSI reconstruction and highlights the transformative impact of deep learning-based hyperspectral image reconstruction on agricultural and food products and anticipates a future where these innovations will lead to more advanced and widespread applications in the agri-food industry.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, harvesting, sorting, and packaging fruit and vegetables are still done manually, despite the hard work this represents. The features that experts commonly use to sorting the date palm fruit are size, color, shape, and texture. Recently, it has started to design and develop artiﬁcial vision systems that consider the criteria of size, color, shape, and texture to automate these processes. However, the development of these systems is complex due to the lack of labeled datasets that facilitate the creation of models to locate, recognize and classify palm date fruit. This dataset is entitled Medjool, an image dataset of different sizes and maturity levels of Medjool dates. Researchers may use this data to develop a model for automatic location, recognition, classiﬁcation, and visual counting of the Medjool dates on trays taking into account their visual features such as shape, color, size, and texture. This dataset was collected from the ﬁrst-round harvest at Palmeras RQ Ranch in Mexicali, Mexico. Images acquisition was performed in natural light. The dataset comprises 2,576 annotated images in two formats, YOLO and PascalVOC format.},

	abstract = {The expansion of Data Science projects in organizations has been led by three factors: the growth in the amount of data generated, the evolution in storage capacity, and the increase in computational capabilities. However, most of these projects fail to deliver the expected value: 82\% of the teams do not use any process model. Despite the popularity of Agile Methods, their adoption in Data Science projects is still scarce. Most of the existing research focuses on algorithms. There is a lack of studies on agility in Data Science. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was performed to identify and evaluate 16 studies that can answer how to adapt and apply CRISP-DM using different approaches — methods, frameworks, or process models. In addition, it shows how CRISP-DM has evolved over the last few decades, with derivations emerging from rigid processes to agile methods. This research then analyzes the 16 tailored models and examines the similarities and differences between CRISP-DM derivatives. As a result, it summarizes the CRISP-DM adaptation patters identified, such as phase addition, phase modification, features and tools addition, and integration with other approaches. Consequently, this SLR showcases how CRISP-DM is a robust, flexible, and highly adaptable model that can be extended to different business domains. Finally, it proposes a theoretical guide to modify and customize CRISP-DM for Data Science projects.},

The paper then explores what key actions data science teams using CRISP-DM should consider that addresses CRISP-DM’s weaknesses. In brief, CRISPDM, which is the most popular framework teams use to execute data science projects, provides an easy to understand description of the data science project workflow (i.e., the data science life cycle). However, CRISP-DM’s project phases miss some key aspects of the data science project life cycle. In addition, CRISPDM’s task-focused approach fails to address how a team should prioritize tasks, and in general, collaborate and communicate. Hence, this paper also describes how CRISP-DM could be combined with a team coordination framework, such as Scrum or Data Driven Scrum, which is a newer collaboration framework developed to address the unique data science coordination challenges.},

	abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a uniﬁed framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identiﬁcation of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class uniﬁes six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this uniﬁcation, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

	abstract = {An in-depth determination of date fruit properties belonging to a given variety can have an impact on their consumption, processing, and storage. The objective of this study was to characterize date fruits of the ‘Mejhoul’ variety using (i) objective and non-destructive image-analysis features and (ii) measurements of physicochemical parameters. Based on images acquired using a digital camera, more than 1600 texture parameters from the individual color channels L, a, b, R, G, B, X, Y, and Z, and 40 geometric characteristics (including linear dimensions and shape factors for each fruit), were determined. Additionally, pomological features, water content, water activity, color parameters (L*, a*, b*), total soluble solids (TSS), reducing sugars, and total sugars were measured. As a main result, the application of machine vision allowed for the correct detection of ‘Mejhoul’ dates and the determination of the image features. The differences in the values of the histogram’s mean (HMean texture) for individual color channels were determined. The ‘Mejhoul’ date fruit images in color channel a (aHMean equal to 145.88) and color channel b (bHMean: 145.49) were the brightest, and in channel Z they were the darkest (ZHMean: 4.23). Due to the determination of the elliptic shape factor (W1) of 1.000 and the circular shape factor (W2) of 0.110, the elliptical shape of the fruit was conﬁrmed. On the other hand, ‘Mejhoul’ dates were characterized by a length of 47.3 mm, a diameter of 26.4 mm, ﬂesh thickness of 6.25 mm, total soluble solids of 62.1\%, water content of 28.0\%, water activity of 0.652, hardness of 694 g, reducing sugars of 13.8\%, and total sugars of 58.8\%. Due to the determination of many image features and other parameters, this paper presents the ﬁrst comprehensive characterization of ‘Mejhoul’ date fruits using a non-destructive imaging technique linked to some physicochemical quality attributes.},

	abstract = {Accurate yield estimation and optimised nitrogen management is essential in agriculture. Remote sensing (RS) systems are being more widely used in building decision support tools for contemporary farming systems to improve yield production and nitrogen management while reducing operating costs and environmental impact. However, RS based approaches require processing of enormous amounts of remotely sensed data from diﬀerent platforms and, therefore, greater attention is currently being devoted to machine learning (ML) methods. This is due to the capability of machine learning based systems to process a large number of inputs and handle nonlinear tasks. This paper discusses research developments conducted within the last 15 years on machine learning based techniques for accurate crop yield prediction and nitrogen status estimation. The paper concludes that the rapid advances in sensing technologies and ML techniques will provide cost-eﬀective and comprehensive solutions for better crop and environment state estimation and decision making. More targeted application of the sensor platforms and ML techniques, the fusion of diﬀerent sensor modalities and expert knowledge, and the development of hybrid systems combining diﬀerent ML and signal processing techniques are all likely to be part of precision agriculture (PA) in the near future.},
